This is just a small project for Apoc to take on.

I'll be implementing a 'script' engine for .NET.

It's a pretty simple concept, that'll hopefully make stuff easy for us in the end.

In short; I'm not creating any new languages, etc. I'm simply making any .NET language... scriptable!

Please; do not edit this code UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

There is a lot of compilation, and cross-AppDomain wrapping going on. If you fuck it up, it's your own damned fault.
